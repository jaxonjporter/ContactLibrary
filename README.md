### Things I would like to add.

I didn't get to adding all the features that I wanted to. Here is a brief list of things I was planning on adding.
  1. While you can add and delete contacts, the only action that gets the information from the ASP.Net server is the initial Get. 
  2. I want to move the css to more specific files.
  3. The ability to drag and drop the contacts to be in a different order.
